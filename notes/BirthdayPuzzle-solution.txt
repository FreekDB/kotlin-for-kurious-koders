/**
 * A puzzle: Calvin and Hobbes are celebrating their birthdays.
 *
 * One is '44' in base a,
 * the other is '55' in base b,
 * the sum of their ages is '77' in base c and
 * the difference is '111' in base d.
 * d < a < b < c and all are natural numbers.
 * Hobbes is younger than Calvin.
 *
 * P.S. The names of my colleagues have been replaced by those of two famous
 * last century cartoon characters:
 * "Calvin and Hobbes follows the humorous antics of the title characters:
 * Calvin, a precocious, mischievous and adventurous six-year-old boy; and
 * Hobbes, his sardonic stuffed tiger."

// Ages were 32 and 45, so the sum is 77 and the difference is 13.
// Bases should be a: 7, b: 8, c: 10, and d: 3.
